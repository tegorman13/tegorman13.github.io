Welcome to my website! 

I recently defended my dissertation and completed a joint PhD in Cognitive Science and Psychology at Indiana University. My research focuses on computational models of learning and generalization, with a particular interest in using neural network models to test theories of how experience shapes internal representations. I am also interested in exploring the factors that influence generalization, such as training sequence and variability, and in developing methods to compare human behavior to large-scale deep learning models. My work spans various domains, including category learning, visuomotor skill learning, and decision making, and I employ a combination of experimental and computational modeling approaches to investigate these topics.
