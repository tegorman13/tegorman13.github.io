## Installation

The devtools library is required for installation:

``` r

```

## Quick start

```

```

NOTE: after restarting RStudio, you can make a vertical project by choosing File > New Project... in RStudio, and choosing the Vertical Research Project template.

Read the [getting started](https://crumplab.github.io/vertical/articles/vertical.html) tutorial to learn more about using `vertical`. And, watch [vertical tutorials on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDtczbtj66Q4jn-08HaBbz6fAVdlQ3EQm), still in progress adding more as we find time.
