The central goal of the proposed dissertation is to examine the extent to which similarity-based learning and generalization models can account for the common empirical patterns found throughout the literature on varied training. Towards this end, I have conducted my own experiments designed to address some shortcomings of previous work. I will also make use of preexisting, "natural" data from a popular online game.
