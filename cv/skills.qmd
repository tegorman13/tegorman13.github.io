# 22nd


I am highly proficient in using R for data analysis, modelling and visualization. The code sample demonstrates my strong capabilities across several key areas:

- Data manipulation and transformation using packages like dplyr, data.table, tidyr and purrr. I can efficiently wrangle and reshape datasets into suitable formats for analysis.

- Parallel computing with the future and furrr packages to speed up compute-intensive tasks. I know how to leverage multi-core architectures to dramatically improve runtime.

- Implementation of advanced modelling techniques like Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) for simulation-based parameter inference. I constructed flexible functions to run the ABC algorithm under various configurations.

- Statistical modelling of experimental psychology data, including hierarchical models with subject-level parameters. I can fit and compare different cognitive models to behavioral data.

- Production of publication-quality figures using ggplot2. I created multi-panel plots to visualize model fits and compare residuals across experimental conditions. 

- Dynamic report generation with R Markdown, knitr and related packages. The code snippets include cache settings and figure options, demonstrating knowledge of these tools.

In summary, I have extensive experience applying R to real-world data analysis problems, especially in the domain of cognitive modelling. My skills span the entire pipeline from data ingestion and cleaning to statistical inference and communication of results.
